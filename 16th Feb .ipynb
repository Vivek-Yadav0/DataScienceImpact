    "'''Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "Solution:\n",
    "A database is an organized collection of data that is stored and accessed electronically. \n",
    "It is designed to efficiently manage, store, and retrieve large amounts of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are based on the relational model and use SQL as the primary language to manipulate data. SQL databases are highly structured, with data organized into tables that have predefined relationships with one another. \n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases, on the other hand, are non-relational and do not use a traditional table-based schema. Instead, they are based on document-oriented, key-value, column-family, or graph databases. NoSQL databases are highly scalable and flexible, making them ideal for handling large and unstructured datasets.\n",

    "''' Q2. What is DDL? Explain why CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are used with an example.\n",
    "Solution:\n",
    "DDL stands for Data Definition Language, and it is a set of SQL commands used to define and manage the structure of a database. DDL commands allow you to create, modify, and delete database objects such as tables, indexes, and views.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. CREATE: The CREATE command is used to create a new database object, such as a table or view. For example, the following SQL statement creates a new table called \"students\" with three columns:\n",
    "CREATE TABLE students (\n",
    "   id INT,\n",
    "   name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "   age INT\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. DROP: The DROP command is used to remove an existing database object, such as a table or view. For example, the following SQL statement drops the \"students\" table:\n",
    "DROP TABLE students;\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ALTER: The ALTER command is used to modify an existing database object, such as a table or view. For example, the following SQL statement adds a new column called \"marks\" to the \"students\" table:\n",
    "ALTER TABLE students ADD COLUMN marks INT;\n",
    "\n",
    "4. TRUNCATE: The TRUNCATE command is used to remove all data from an existing table. Unlike the DROP command, TRUNCATE preserves the structure of the table. For example, the following SQL statement removes all data from the \"students\" table:\n",
    "TRUNCATE TABLE students;\n",

    "\n",
    "1. INSERT: The INSERT command is used to add new data to a table. For example, the following SQL statement inserts a new row into the \"students\" table:\n",
    "INSERT INTO students (id,name,age,marks)\n",
    "VALUES (1,'vivek',22,67);\n",
    "\n",
    "2. UPDATE: The UPDATE command is used to modify existing data in a table. For example, the following SQL statement updates the marks of the students with id 1 in the \"students\" table:\n",
    "UPDATE students SET marks = 78 where id=1;\n",
    "\n",
    "3. DELETE: The DELETE command is used to remove data from a table. For example, the following SQL statement deletes the student with id 1 from the \"students\" table:\n",
